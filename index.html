    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        "The real measure of success is how many times you can bounce back from failure." - Thomas Edison <br><br>

        Hello! I'm Aaron Upadhyay, a fourth-year student in Automation Engineering Technology at McMaster University, specializing in Smart Systems.
        Alongside my Bachelor of Technology degree, I'm also pursuing an Advanced Diploma in Chemical Engineering and a Business Management certificate from Mohawk College, building a strong foundation in technical expertise and business strategy. <br>

        With a passion for innovation and a problem-solving mindset, I'm drawn to opportunities that blend engineering, technology, and data to create impactful solutions.
        I enjoy leveraging data-driven insights to make informed decisions, designing products that enhance performance, and exploring creative approaches to solve complex challenges. 
        Through my internships and extracurricular activities, I've been able to contribute effectively in dynamic, tech-driven environments. <br>

        I'm always open to connecting with professionals, sharing ideas, and exploring opportunities for collaboration. Feel free to reach out on LinkedIn or via email at Aaronnu03@gmail.ca - I'd love to chat!
    </p>
